# Pollution-Project
sophia_magcale@redlands.edu
The project is about finding the concentration of ocean pollution, including plastic and chemical pollution, and how they are affecting the marine environment. Specifically, the pollution we focus on are made by humans, meaning that they don't naturally occur in nature. We want to use this to find the impact that humans have on the ocean.

This project is analyzing a specfic group of man made pollutions such as chemicals that are disposed of in the ocean. We want to show the harm on marine life and its ecosystems. Man made pollutions means that they are not naturally produced but are made by human beings artifically.
