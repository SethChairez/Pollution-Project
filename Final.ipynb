    "\n",
    "Our project explores algal blooms and its potential dangers. We specifically focus on the algae Alexandrium Catenella in the oceans surrounding northern Alaska. We first analyze the concentrations of the algae, in their cyst and cell forms, and how factors like temperature and salinity may affect these numbers. We then take these findings and consider how it may affect the food web/chain, considering how the algae may accumulate in sea life which is then consumed as seafood."

    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In our initial proposal, we were aiming to study the concentrations of different man-made chemicals in various areas of the ocean surrounding the United States, and how these could possible contribute to the health of marine life and the nearby human population. After doing some exploratory analysis in our initial dataset, we found that the three chemicals/compounds that researchers took the most samples of were organic carbon, pentachlorobuphenyl, and phosphated pesticides.\n",
    "\n",
    "We did some further research in how each of these three substances can affect human/marine life and we were mostly interested in the effects of phosphated pesticides. Algae feeds off of phosphorus, so when phosphorus enters the marine ecosystem then the algae population increases rapidly. Phosphorus is commonly used in pesticides, and \"phosphated pesticides\" tend to enter the ocean through runoff pollution. This leads into what is known as an algal bloom. \n",
    "\n",
    "We found a dataset that contained information specifically about the algae called Alexandrium Catenella, but it did not have any data pertaining to phosphated pesticides or any other chemicals. We were still very interested in the topic of algal blooms, so our questions shifted to reflect this new dataset. We now wanted to explore if there was a certain set of environmental conditions that allowed Alexandrium Catenella to thrive, if there are certain areas that seem to be at risk for an algal bloom, and how this could potentially affect marine and human life. \n",
    "\n",
    "We found two datasets, one with samples that collected Alexandrium cells and one with samples that collected Alexandrium cysts. To understand the difference between the two, it is important to have a sense of the life cycle of Alexandrium Catenella. The algae begins as a cyst that can remain in a dormant stage for a long period of time, meaning that it can survive despite unfavorable environmental conditions or starvation. Once environmental conditions are good, the cyst becomes an \"active cell\" that can asexually reproduce by repeatedly splitting in half. If conditions become unfavorable again, the cells fuse to become dormant cysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alexandrium Catenella produces the compound saxitoxin, or STX for short. STXs are known for bioaccumulating in fish and shellfish, meaning that its concentration within these organisms builds up over a period of time. This is because the compound metabolizes/breaks down slower than it accumulates. Although STXs may not immediately kill the fish/shellfish that they accumulate in, they can cause serious harm to humans who consume seafood. Specifically, STXs are known to cause PSP, short for Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning. Symptoms can develop within minutes or it can take up to a few hours. Symptoms include tingling in the fingers and toes, fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, and numbness/paralysis of the limbs. Muscles in the chest and abdomen may also be paralyzed which can cause death because of inability to breathe. \n",
    "\n",
    "To draw connections between these algal blooms and its impact on humans, we found a third dataset with information about seafood sales in Alaska. Alaska is known for being a big source of seafood so it is worth knowing how much seafood it produces and sells, but also specifically what kind of seafood it produces and sells. We are most interested in shellfish, but STXs can accumulate in other fish as well which increases the risk of PSP."

Samples were collected in the Northern Bering Sea, Chukchi Shelf, and Beaufort Shelf, the ocean surrounding the northwestern coast of Alaska. Cruises would sail out to a variety of sites across these oceans, which allowed a wider range of the ocean to be covered. For the cells, researchers would collect 2-liter samples. For the cysts, researchers would collect sediment samples. These samples were processed in a laboratory and analyzed for cell/cyst abundance.\n",
